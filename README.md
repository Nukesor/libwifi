First of all, this library is designed to be easily extendable. \
There's an architectural/contribution guide in `docs/Frame.md` and pull requests are highly welcome.

Covering the whole spectrum of possible 802.11 frames or all different implementations of wifi tools out there is an impossible task for a single person, let's try to tackle this together!

## What is Libwifi

The first goal of `libwifi` is to provide a **convenient** way of parsing raw IEEE 802.11 frames!

The emphasis is on **convenient**, since this library doesn't focus on providing a ultra high-performance implementation. The focus is rather on providing an easy-to-use API. \
This includes consistent and intuitive structs representing the structure of a given frame. \
However, this doesn't mean that this library [isn't quite fast anyway ;)](https://github.com/Nukesor/libwifi#performance).

The second goal is to provide an unified API to:

1. query information about your wifi interfaces (iwlist equivalent).
2. set attributes and configure your wifi interfaces (iwconfig equivalent).

As a prototype it's planned to call and parse existing binaries.
However, a native re-implementation of those tools is desired in a long-term manner. \
For instance, the [wireless-tools](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/wireless-tools) are a great C-library with a lot of documentation and very will structured code.
This could be used as a guide-line for re-implementation.

The project is still under heavy development, and a lot of features are missing, but it should be a good foundation for a proper wifi library :).

## How to use it

Parsing a frame is fairly straight forward:

```rs
use libwifi::parse_frame;

// A simple RTS frame
let bytes = [
    180, 0, // FrameControl
    158, 0, // Duration
    116, 66, 127, 77, 29, 45, // First Address
    20, 125, 218, 170, 84, 81, // Second Address
];

match libwifi::parse_frame(&bytes) {
    Ok(frame) => {
        println!("Got frame: {frame:?}");
    }
    Err(err) => {
        println!("Error during parsing :\n{err:?}");
    }
};
```

A full example on how to capture, process and parse wifi traffic can be found in the `examples` directory.

## Performance

There are a few benches in the `benches` folder.

1. Install `cargo-criterion` by calling `cargo install cargo-criterion`.
2. Run the benchmarks with `cargo criterion`.

Right now, parsing a `Beacon` frame, which is one of the more complex frames, takes `~1 Âµs` on a i7-8550U. \
Parsing a `Data` frame takes `~84 ns`.

If we take this as a rough guideline, you can roughly expect a million frames per second.

**Disclaimer:** This will most likely become slower, as more missing features/parsers will be added to the library.
    Anyhow, I don't expect this to drop below 100k frames/s.

## Roadmap and TODOs

### Parser and Frames

- [ ] Implement basic parsers for all frame subtypes.
- [ ] Add specialized parsers for fields that are currently generically handled by the `StationInfo` struct.
- [ ] Handle all edge-cases (there are a lot and I'll need help!)

### Interface handling

I would love to add proper interface handling to the library.
This includes features to:

- [ ] Switch modes
- [ ] Switch channels
- [ ] Discover available channels

There's a lot more to the IEE 802.11 spec and a lot of stuff needs to be done. \
If you find that something you need is missing, consider creating a ticket and contributing :).
